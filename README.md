# Programming-Challenges (PCs)
PCs (programming challenges) from my C++ book , "C++ From Control Structures Through Objects" Eighth Edition Brief by Tony Gaddis.

I might hop around a little but now I'm in chapter 13 of 15. I'm almost done. I'm so excited. I would like to learn more and start to make programs or games. After this will probably get more C++ books
and/or start learning ruby. 

Currently on chapter 13: Classes.
